# Umami by Sushi1056
A Balatro mod Iâ€™m working on. 

**Current content:** 
- A new tarot, "SOUL E.X.", which upgrades non-food jokers into a legendary-equivalent rarity for 1 Ante
- Upgraded versions of Riff-Raff, Baron, Bloodstone, Space Joker, Hallucination, Luchador, Sock and Buskin, and Mime
- New art for Riff-Raff, Baron, Hiker, and Jimbo
- Retexture of Baron to have a historically-accurate crown 

**To-Do List before initial alpha release:** 
- Finish more JOKER E.X. variants
- Create logic that transforms Jokers into their E.X. variant and back again
- Create placeholder art
- Make an E.X. deck where you start with a SOUL E.X. tarot

**To-do list before full release 1.0.0:** 
- make an indicator appear on compatible Jokers when a SOUL E.X. tarot is selected
- Dynamically updating description text on SOUL E.X. tarot card indicating number of Jokers that can transform
- Code for dynamically updating Joker art
- config page

## Planned additions for future updates: 
**Cross-mod content for JOKER E.X. upgrades of "Alternate Vanilla" mods:** 
- Ortalab
- Familiar

**Alternate SOUL E.X. art for corresponding tarot types**

**New mechanic that modifies jokers if the mod detects that "Unlock All" has been used on the profile**
- New Spectral "Amnesia", which removes all stickers (including stake stickers!) from a Joker, un-discovers it, removes it from the collection, and then destroys it
- A set of Jokers that scale based on the number of locked/undiscovered Jokers in the collection
- Vouchers that reduce or remove the punishment for unlocking all
- "Showcase Deck", start with those couchers redeemed and a random Umami joker

**"Meme Jokers" which are either nearly useless, or incredibly unbalanced but tedious to use** 
- Joker that "balances chip and mult" (not a typo, it will literally only balance one chip/mult)
- Mari: X13 mult, triggers 139 times
- Ability to disable meme jokers in config
